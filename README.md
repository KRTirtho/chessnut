# Chessnut 

#### Theme for Visual Studio Code

It's a special theme for visual studio with inspiration of a chestnut's  wonderful color & visual design. Even though its name is **Chessnut** which doesn't matches the name of actual chestnut and also its alphabetically wrong. But its a name only so don't worry about that. It's an awesome theme. Hope you guys will like it.
